# Configuring the x80

If you are using a x80 you have some options to consider:\
\
**One, Two or Three switch morse functionality**

**Length of a dot**&#x20;

**Fast Typing**



There are a plethora of other configuration settings in userConfig.py - which you are welcome to edit. Just [note the details](switch-control-mode-and-morse-mode.md) about saving to the board particularly if you want to use the switch control mode or access more than one Bluetooth device. You will need to press switch 1 & 3 to reset the saving function.
