# Switching between switch and morse mode

**Change number of allowed connected devices**

By default the system is set for two devices. If morace is told to switch connected devices and the device isn't available after 5 seconds it reverts to the previously connected device.

If you want more devices simply change "MAXIMUM\_SWAP\_CONNECTIONS" in userConfig.h
