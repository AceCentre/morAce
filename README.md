# morAce

morAce is a Arduino project designed to work with the [Adafruit nrf52840](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062) range of arduino boards - and converts 1, 2 or 3 switch inputs into HID keyboard/Mouse commands. A mode switch allows the device to switch between connected devices meaning you can use this on different computers - with no software or cables since its over Bluetooth.

## What does it do exactly?

You can use switches (1, 2, or 3) to send morse code signals which are then intepreted by the morAce as Keyboard strokes or mouse movements. Its configurable by editing the arduino file. It will work on any device that listens to a Bluetooth keyboard our mouse - such as an iOS device, Mac, Windows devices. Also with a fourth switch you can change which device it is currently connected to. It cycles between already paired devices.

### Usage

Wire it all up. Set your settings in ``userConfig.h``. Pair your device with a compatible device (PC, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android) - and away you go.

There **will** be bugs. Please submit them to the [issue queue](https://github.com/AceCentre/BLEMorseToText/issues).

#### Shortcuts

We have some predefined shortcuts that you can edit yourself. Edit the morseCode.cpp file to add your own
E.g.

- `---...-.`      "My name is Morace"
- `-..--.`        "No problem"
- `-..---.`       "Thank you"
- `-.-...--.-..`  "See you later"
- `..--..---..`   "How are you?"

And keyboard commands Such as :
- `....----` SHORTCUT_CTRL_C
- `...-----` SHORTCUT_CTRL_V
- `..--.`    SHORTCUT_WIN_TAB
- `..-....`  SHORTCUT_WIN_H

#### Mouse mode

Once a device is connected by default it can send characters. But if you want to control it as a mouse you can enter the mouse mode. This is done with the morse command of `  .-.--` (configurable in userConfig.h) and then the device can send mouse commands

*NB: in iOS you need to make sure Settings -> Accessibility -> AssistiveTouch -> On.*

Then to move the mouse it works choose a direction (see more below). If you want to keep moving the mouse in that direction use the "Repeat command" (`.---.-`)

|             	|   Up<br>-   	|               	|
|-------------	|:-----------:	|---------------	|
| Left<br> .. 	|             	| Right<br> ... 	|
|             	| Down<br> -- 	|               	|

Mouse buttons are:

- `.--`  Right Click
- `.-` Left Click 
- `..--` Double Right click
- `..-` Double Left click

 - `.--.`  MOUSE_MOVE_LEFT_UP          
 - `...-`  MOUSE_MOVE_RIGHT_UP         
 - `...--` MOUSE_MOVE_LEFT_DOWN        
 - `...---` MOUSE_MOVE_RIGHT_DOWN      
 - `.--`   MOUSE_CLICK_RIGHT
 - `.-`    MOUSE_CLICK_LEFT
 - `..--`  MOUSE_DB_CLICK_RIGHT
 - `..-`   MOUSE_DB_CLICK_LEFT
 
 - `.-..--` Speed Increase
 - `.-..-.` Speed Decrease

#### Repeat/Hold commands

- `.---.-` Repeat whatever was the last action e.g. a keypress or mouse movement
- `.---.-.` Hold command. Send this first THEN the next key will be held down. eg for shifting a letter
- `.---.--` Release command. Send this to release any held down command. 
 

#### Change number of allowed connected devices

By default the system is set for two devices. If morace is told to switch connected devices and the device isn't available after 5 seconds it reverts to the previously connected device. 

If you want more devices simply change "MAXIMUM_SWAP_CONNECTIONS" in userConfig.h

## Want to learn morse?

Try our [Morse-Learn](https://github.com/AceCentre/morse-learn/) Project. 

Or if you are on a PC and want a way of learning how to use the mouse with visual feedback back try [MorseWriter](https://github.com/AceCentre/MorseWriter).

## Why? Why not a different project?

We needed a BLE HID Switch->Morse system - that allowed swapping between several different devices - AND - switching between switch scanning and morse input.
